# SURFACE PROSPECTS

**Sector Dispatch: L2 | Field Assignment #0089-SP**

Outstanding work in the Training Shallows, contractor.

Your initial performance metrics exceeded baseline expectations by 23%, which puts you solidly in the "probably won't die immediately" category. The accounting department is pleased, and more importantly, so are we.

Your next assignment takes you to Surface Prospects, a shallow asteroid field with reliable mineral distribution and excellent profit margins. Recent geological surveys confirm substantial duranium deposits throughout the accessible layers, with promising pentrilium concentrations at depth.

> [!NOTE] Surface Prospects features elevated thermal activity. Your rig may encounter lava flows that require navigation or demolition to bypass safely.

The mineral composition here runs richer than the training zones - expect heavier loads of duranium with occasional pentrilium strikes as you dig deeper. Pure mineral formations appear more frequently at depth, so don't be afraid to push your drilling envelope. Just remember that deeper excavation requires better equipment and more fuel reserves.

> [!TIP] Repair nanites are now available at your local SpaceCo depot. These self-assembling repair bots can patch hull breaches and system damage during field operations.

Your outpost has been upgraded with expanded inventory and improved vehicle options. The engineering team recommends upgrading your combustion system and drill assembly before attempting deeper extraction runs.

We've also introduced our new emergency teleportation service for contractors who find themselves... inconveniently located. The rates are competitive with certain death, and significantly more convenient.

Remember: every load of ore you extract strengthens SpaceCo's market position and builds toward your eventual retirement package. Current projections suggest you're on track for "basic atmospheric privileges" by age 67.

Keep drilling, contractor. The Belt's not going to mine itself.
