# TRAINING SHALLOWS

**Deep Belt Initiative | Contractor Orientation Package #001-TS**

Welcome to the Deep Belt Initiative, contractor.

You've signed the waivers, passed the basic medical screening, and somehow convinced our insurance department you're worth the premium. Congratulations - you're now officially expendable in the name of progress and profit.

Your first assignment drops you into the Training Shallows, a carefully selected asteroid cluster with manageable mineral deposits and relatively stable geology. Think of it as your corporate-sponsored introduction to not dying in the void.

> [!IMPORTANT] Your drilling rig responds to drag commands. Plot your course by dragging from your current position to where you want to go. The autopilot handles the rest.

> [!NOTE] Access your onboard console anytime with **Esc** or the **Console** button. Your rig doesn't pause when the console is open - plan accordingly.

Your rig comes standard with a basic combustion engine, entry-level bore bit, and minimal cargo space. It'll get you started, but don't expect miracles. Upgrades are available at the surface outpost once you've proven you can turn rock into revenue.

The shallows contain abundant tritanium deposits - the bread and butter of asteroid mining. Easy to extract, light to haul, and always in demand. You'll also find scattered duranium veins as you go deeper, along with the occasional pure mineral formation that'll make your quarterly earnings report look respectable.

> [!TIP] Move close to the SpaceCo outpost to access **Trade** options. Sell your haul, refuel, repair, and upgrade your equipment.

Your **Pension Credits** accumulate with every transaction, every mile drilled, every day survived. Stack enough and you might afford that retirement colony with actual atmosphere and synthetic gravity. The company handbook suggests 25,000 credits for "basic comfort" - but between you and us, aim higher.

> [!WARNING] Running out of fuel or taking critical damage will immobilize your rig. SpaceCo offers emergency teleport services, but the rates reflect our monopoly on caring whether you live or die.

Remember: you're not just mining minerals. You're building SpaceCo's **Galactic Market Share**, one load of ore at a time. Every sale strengthens our position in the sector and gets you closer to that pension package.

Start shallow, drill smart, and try not to become a cautionary tale in next month's safety briefing.

Good luck, and good drilling.
