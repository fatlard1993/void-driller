**Personal Log Entry - Contractor #2847** _"Found something today that wasn't in any geological survey. Smooth, warm to the touch, with an unusual ovoid shape. When I picked it up, I could swear I heard singing. Not human singing. Something older. The site supervisor got very excited when I reported it, said there were others scattered throughout the Belt. What happened here before we arrived?"_
