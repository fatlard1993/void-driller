**Encrypted Transmission Fragment - Unknown Source** _"The scattered-ones rest like stars across the broken-home-place. Each one carries the song-memory of what-was-before. The small-ones-who-dig that seek bright-hard-things, perhaps they will understand. Perhaps we can use them to bring the lost-ones home. The harmony grows stronger with each recovered. Soon the great-song will sing again."_
