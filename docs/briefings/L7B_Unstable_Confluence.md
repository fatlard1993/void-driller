# UNSTABLE CONFLUENCE

**Alternate Site Assessment: L7B | Secondary Extraction Zone #0267-UCB**

Volatile crystalline formations present enhanced extraction challenges and corresponding mineral value increases. Site designation upgraded due to exceptional pure mineral concentration.

**Safety Protocol:** Elevated hazard density requires comprehensive emergency preparedness. Advanced teleportation systems mandatory for all operations.

**Procurement Note:** Next-generation drilling technology available for field testing. Performance metrics exceed standard operational parameters.

**Intercepted Internal Memo - Dr. Elena Vasquez to Research Coordination** _"The crystalline arrangements here defy explanation. Geometric patterns suggest deliberate placement rather than natural formation. Some specimens emit harmonic frequencies that correlate with our deep-space arrays. Requesting enhanced security clearance for detailed analysis. Something is orchestrating these formations."_
