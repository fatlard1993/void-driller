# THERMAL BREACH

**Alternate Site Assessment: L9B | Secondary Extraction Zone #0445-TBB**

Extreme thermal conditions have created unique geological structures with exceptional mineral accessibility. Enhanced compensation reflects elevated operational requirements.

**Thermal Advisory:** Maximum temperature operational limits expected. Advanced cooling systems and emergency evacuation protocols mandatory.

**Equipment Access:** Prototype gravitational manipulation devices available for operational testing. Early deployment authorization granted for qualified contractors.

**Corrupted Data Fragment - Site Supervisor Log** _"Day 47: The temperature readings don't make sense. Heat sources appear to be artificial, not geological. Found metallic structures embedded in the rock that predate any known mining operations. Team reporting strange dreams about 'songs in the stone.' Requesting immediate backup and enhanced psychological evaluation protocols."_
