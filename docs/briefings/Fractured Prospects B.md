# FRACTURED PROSPECTS B

**Alternate Site Assessment: L3B | Secondary Extraction Zone #0124-FPB**

Enhanced mineral distribution detected through advanced geological analysis. Site classification upgraded due to exceptional specimen concentration and accelerated extraction opportunities.

**Environmental Advisory:** Extreme terrain variation expected. Advanced emergency equipment recommended for optimal safety margins.

**Operational Notes:** Early access to enhanced drilling systems available through site procurement. Elevated specimen recovery rates documented in preliminary surveys.

_"Day 12: The mineral distribution here doesn't match any standard geological models. It's almost like someone deliberately scattered high-grade materials throughout the formation. The acoustic readings are unusual. Recommend full geological survey before large-scale operations commence. Also, found some kind of smooth ovoid formations embedded in the rock. They're warm to the touch and emit faint harmonic frequencies. Site supervisor says to keep quiet about them."_
