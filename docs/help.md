## üëã Welcome

Out here on the edge of civilization, the asteroid belt is full of rocks no sane person would touch - and minerals no corporate exec can resist. That's where you come in.

You're the pilot of a heavily modified drilling rig, newly assigned to SpaceCo's Deep Belt Initiative. Your job: mine, survive, and turn a profit in the cold dark void. It's dangerous work, but the pay _might_ be worth it.

As you work, you'll earn **Pension Credits** - SpaceCo's version of a retirement fund. Every mineral sale, equipment purchase, and service transaction adds to your pension. Stack enough and you might just afford that retirement colony with actual atmosphere and synthetic gravity.

You'll begin at a SpaceCo outpost, equipped with just enough to get started. Check your console, scan for minerals, and start drilling.

Drill deep, stay sharp, and try not to die. SpaceCo's emergency services are expensive.

## üéÆ Controls

- **Mouse / Touch:** Drag a path for your drill - your vehicle follows it automatically
- **Esc:** Open or close the player console
- **Use items** - Select from the console's **Items** tab
- **Interact with SpaceCo** - Move close to the surface outpost to trigger a **Trade** button
- **Trade with other players** - Move your rig close to theirs to trigger a **Trade** button

> [!IMPORTANT] The console **DOES NOT** pause the game. Plan your stops carefully when accessing menus underground.

## üñ•Ô∏è Player Console

Your drill rig comes equipped with a built-in console interface - your lifeline when you're deep in the dark.

Open the console at any time (`Esc` or "Console" button) to access essential subsystems:

- **Cargo:** Review your mineral haul and weight status
- **Status:** See your vehicle's condition, fuel, and inventory capacity
- **Items:** Use your carried items from inventory slots
- **Settings:** Configure volume, alerts, default menu
- **Help:** Reopen this guide anytime

You can change which tab opens by default in the **Settings** menu - useful if you want instant access to cargo stats or your tool belt.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

Accessible from the **player console**:

- **Volume controls** for music, effects, and ambient sounds
- **Alerts** for low fuel, cargo full, or low health
- **Startup Menu** to choose which submenu opens when you join

## ‚õèÔ∏è Mining

SpaceCo operations focus on extracting valuable minerals from asteroid rock formations. Point your rig at some rock and let the drill do the rest, but there's strategy involved.

- **Harder rock requires tougher drills** to mine and uses more fuel per tile
- Drill through mineral-bearing rock to collect **ore deposits**, automatically stored in your cargo hold
- Find **pure mineral formations** embedded in rock - these are worth **twice as much** as raw ore
- **Cargo weight affects fuel consumption** - heavier loads increase fuel usage by up to 20%
- You can't drill new rock at 100% cargo capacity - return to surface to sell

If things get dicey, plot a course back to the surface to refuel, repair, or rethink your strategy. The deeper you go, the more valuable the minerals - and the more dangerous the environment becomes.

## üöö Vehicle Configuration

SpaceCo provides modular drilling rigs with four core components:

### **Vehicle Frame**

Controls base stats like health, fuel capacity, cargo space, and inventory slots. Larger vehicles carry more but cost more to operate.

### **Engine**

Determines your fuel type, power output (torque), and fuel efficiency. More powerful engines enable stronger drills but require premium fuel types.

### **Drill**

Allows breaking minerals of matching strength or weaker. Requires sufficient engine torque to operate - stronger drills need more power.

### **Part**

Optional enhancement that can boost any combination of stats. Only **one part** may be equipped at a time, so choose based on your current limitations or strategy.

## üì¶ Items & Inventory

SpaceCo operations include a comprehensive inventory system for equipment management.

### **Inventory Slots**

Your rig has limited storage slots for items (separate from mineral cargo). Base vehicles start with 8 slots, expanding up to 24 slots with advanced vehicles. Parts can add significant additional inventory space.

### **Item Categories**

Items can be used from your **console inventory** and include:

- **Fuel:** Oil (basic engines), Battery (mid-tier), SOLN (advanced)
- **Mobility:** SpaceCo Teleporter, Advanced Teleporter, SpaceCo Teleport Station
- **Survival:** Repair Nanites for field repairs
- **Demolition:** Timed Charge, Remote Charge, Gravity Charge, Void Implosion
- **Insurance:** Transport Insurance (protects items during inter-asteroid travel)

### **Transport Insurance**

SpaceCo's transport insurance (15 credits per use) protects your entire inventory during inter-asteroid travel. Without insurance, you keep credits and minerals but lose all items during transport. Essential for preserving valuable equipment when moving to new extraction sites.

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Hazards & Survival

The Belt doesn't like being disturbed. SpaceCo operations encounter increasing hazards with depth:

- **Holes:** May block return paths or create navigation challenges
- **Lava:** Burns on contact - avoid or use explosives to create safe passages
- **Gas:** Corrodes hull integrity - avoid or bomb your way around
- **Environmental Life:** Indigenous species may respond to mining activities with varied behaviors

### **Equipment Failure Situations**

If you **run out of fuel or health**, your vehicle becomes immobile. Options include:

- **SpaceCo Remote Rescue:** Costly teleport service (rates scale with SpaceCo development)
- **Emergency Items:** Use teleporters or other escape tools
- **Player Rescue:** In multiplayer, other contractors can assist
- **Abandon Mission:** Start over with basic equipment on the same asteroid

If you **run out of cargo space**, you cannot drill new rock and must return to sell minerals.

## üè™ SpaceCo Services

Return to any **SpaceCo Outpost** to access comprehensive contractor services:

- **Sell Minerals:** Exchange rock and minerals for credits (builds SpaceCo's Galactic Market Share)
- **Buy Items:** Purchase fuel, tools, teleporters, and explosives
- **Upgrade Equipment:** Purchase new vehicles, drills, engines, and parts
- **Refuel & Repair:** Restore your vehicle's operational status
- **Transport Services:** Travel to new asteroids (requires meeting mineral quotas and/or experience levels)

Service costs increase as SpaceCo develops, so early investment in self-sufficiency pays off.

> [!TIP] You don't need to fill your cargo hold before returning - sometimes it's smarter to cash in early and avoid breakdown situations.

## üß™ Minerals

SpaceCo's extraction operations target ten primary mineral types, each existing in two forms:

### **Rock Deposits vs Pure Minerals**

- **Rock Deposits:** Mined directly from ground formations, base value
- **Pure Minerals:** Found embedded in rock, **twice the value** of raw deposits

Deeper excavation increases the frequency of pure mineral discoveries.

| Name | Color | Strength | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tritanium | White | 1 | 6 | Common crystalline deposits found in surface layers. |
| Duranium | Orange | 2 | 9 | Durable base metal with high thermal resistance. |
| Pentrilium | Yellow | 3 | 12 | Sought-after for its refined luster and solid resale margin. |
| Byzanium | Green | 4 | 18 | Can be unstable when stressed, but the payout is worth it. |
| Etherium | Teal | 5 | 22 | Suspended in layered veins, unnervingly quiet when struck. |
| Mithril | Blue | 6 | 26 | Elusive and glossy - hard to find, harder to let go. |
| Octanium | Purple | 7 | 30 | Its fractal structure resists most drills. Found deep. |
| Saronite | Pink | 8 | 34 | Pulsates under low-light conditions. You're not imagining it. |
| Adamantite | Red | 9 | 38 | Visible in early fields, but impossible to extract without serious upgrades. |
| Quadium | Black | 10 | 42 | Rare obsidian-like crystals that seem to absorb light. |

**Note:** Black quadium appears commonly in early levels but requires the strongest drills (T10+) to extract, creating an interesting risk/reward dynamic.

## üåç Asteroid Operations

SpaceCo's Deep Belt Initiative operates across procedurally generated asteroid clusters, each with unique characteristics:

- **Procedural Generation:** Each asteroid features unique depth, hazards, and mineral composition
- **Surface Outposts:** Every site includes a SpaceCo facility for contractor services
- **Finite Resources:** Asteroids have limited minerals - efficient extraction maximizes profits
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Deeper asteroids require stronger equipment but offer better rewards
- **Transport Requirements:** Access to advanced sites requires meeting mineral quotas, and side levels also require SpaceCo experience thresholds

### **Depth Mechanics**

As you dig deeper:

- **Rock hardness increases**, requiring stronger drills
- **Pure minerals become more common**, improving profit margins
- **Hazard frequency rises**, with more environmental dangers and life forms
- **Equipment strain intensifies**, increasing fuel consumption and repair needs

## üåê Multiplayer Operations

SpaceCo supports multiple contractors operating on the same asteroid simultaneously:

- **Real-time Coordination:** Players appear on shared maps for collaborative mining
- **Direct Trading:** Exchange **credits**, **items**, and **minerals** with other contractors
- **Rescue Operations:** Assist stranded contractors or coordinate emergency evacuations
- **Strategic Cooperation:** Coordinate routes, share resources, or specialize roles
- **Shared Progression:** All players contribute to SpaceCo's **Galactic Market Share** growth

Large contractor teams unlock recruitment-based achievements and benefit from increased operational efficiency.

## üèÜ Achievement System

SpaceCo tracks contractor performance through two achievement categories:

### **Player Achievements**

- **Retirement Tiers:** Major pension milestones (1,000 / 2,500 / 5,000 / 10,000 / 25,000 credits) with escalating rewards

### **SpaceCo Achievements**

Track corporate-level progress including:

- **Galactic Market Share:** Company growth and sector dominance
- **Fleet Modernization:** Equipment sales and contractor upgrades
- **Operational Milestones:** Total revenue, service volume, transport completion
- **Recruitment Success:** Contractor team growth and retention

**Inflation Protection:** Achievement rewards automatically scale with SpaceCo's development to maintain purchasing power as prices increase.

## üìö Corporate Background

Following Earth's climate collapse and orbital warfare, the surviving nations formed the **Terran Recovery Accord** - a fragile coalition dependent on off-world resource extraction. SpaceCo emerged as the dominant contractor for asteroid belt operations.

SpaceCo's **Deep Belt Initiative** deploys contractors to remote asteroid sites using modular drilling rigs, competitive insurance coverage, and corporate promises of pension benefits. Each outpost represents a calculated investment in the new space-based economy.

Recent deep excavations have yielded unusual discoveries: unknown energy signatures, impossible geological structures, and mineral formations that challenge current scientific understanding. SpaceCo's official position maintains these are "natural phenomena requiring further study."

You're here for minerals and pension credits. The company's other interests are handled by specialists with higher clearance levels.
