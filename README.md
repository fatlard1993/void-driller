# Void Driller

![logo](./img/logo.png)

> **Void Driller: Mine the Belt** is a retro-style sci-fi mining game set on the edge of known space. You pilot a modular drilling rig, carving through procedurally generated asteroids to extract rare minerals, survive unpredictable hazards, and keep **SpaceCo** happy.
>
> You begin with a modest drill rig and a single goal: **carve out a fortune among the rocks and retire before the void eats you alive**. Every mineral you sell earns **Pension Credits**, pushing you closer to a retirement pod you can actually live in.
>
> Upgrade your rig with stronger drills, more efficient engines, and specialized support modules. Sell your haul, unlock new asteroid zones, and stay one step ahead of fuel shortages, environmental hazards, and things that really shouldnâ€™t be alive down there.
>
> Trade with other players, grow SpaceCoâ€™s **Galactic Market Share**, and unlock SpaceCo-certified achievements as you dig deeper into the Deep Beltâ€™s strangest secrets - one drill cycle at a time.
